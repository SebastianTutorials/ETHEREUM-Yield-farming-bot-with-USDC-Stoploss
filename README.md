This is a simple but highly effective JavaScript local web browser ran high yield farmbot that has a built-in stop loss function the second volatility is detected it pulls from the yield and sells in usdc if you ever said to ethereum network. If you have it set to bnb it will sell into busd , if it's set for the polygon at work it sells into a pegged usdc. USDC was a stable coin chosen because it's the only one back 100% dollar for dollar. 

After the volatility subsides it sells the stable coin and goes back to yield farming, this algorithm of selling before volatility and buying in when volatility subsides greatly increases profit and holdings of the primary coin. 

I made this video tutorial on how to configure it and run it.

The best part the more volatility the more it seems to profit.

Letâ€™s get started.

Part 1. Main software installations.

Extract the Max-yield-farmer-with-stablecoin-stoploss.zip anywhere thats easily accessible to you.

Part 2. Edit the settings.

Open the unzip folder find the "config.js" file and open it with a text editor:

1.Set your wallet address and private key or your wallet seed if you have a wallet that does not give you the private key

2.Set the "networks"  1 = ETH , 2 = BNB , 3 = polygon 

3.Set the "maxspend" max amount you want to uses in the address you provided "make sure you have the amount in your wallet you provided or it will error out" 


Want to thank me my eth/bnb/polygon address is 0x2431bec69aa4699ad9A9aE77233F7bdcD6d631f8
